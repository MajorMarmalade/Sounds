Hey there! This script is designed to give your friends (or even yourself) a little scare. It's all in good fun, of course! When the script is run, it initially waits for any mouse movement to get started. Once it detects that, it plays a loud sound file and covers the entire screen with a fake, but convincing-looking error message.

While the sound is playing, the script continuously raises the volume to maximize the spooky factor. The screen cover remains persistent, making it difficult for the user to access their desktop or switch between windows using ALT+TAB or the Windows key.

After the sound file finishes playing, the script triggers a crash, which will result in a Blue Screen of Death.
