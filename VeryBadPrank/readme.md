Title: Extreme Audio Prank: Inappropriate ASMR

Description: This PowerShell script is designed to play a rather embarrassing and inappropriate audio file, featuring intimate ASMR sounds, as a prank on the user. The volume of the audio will be locked at 100, making it difficult to mute or lower the volume. To stop the audio, the user must locate and close the PowerShell window in time.

Once triggered by a mouse movement, the script plays the audio and continuously raises the volume. After the audio finishes playing, the script will perform a cleanup process, deleting contents of the Temp folder, run box history, PowerShell history, and emptying the recycle bin.

Please use this script responsibly and with the consent of the targeted user, as it may cause discomfort or embarrassment. Remember, pranks should be fun and harmless, not malicious or harmful.
