Title: Knock Knock Joke Prank

Description: This PowerShell script is designed to give users a harmless scare with a knock-knock joke when they move their cursor. After detecting any cursor movement, the script proceeds to increase the volume to the maximum level and then plays a randomly selected knock-knock joke using text-to-speech. These jokes range from light-hearted to mildly unsettling, providing a surprise and a laugh.

After the joke is spoken, the script will also clean up traces of its execution by deleting the contents of the Temp folder, removing run box history, clearing PowerShell history, and emptying the recycle bin.
