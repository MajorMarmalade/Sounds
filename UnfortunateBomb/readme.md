The first script creates text files with names "unfortunateC0.txt", "unfortunateD0.txt", and "unfortunateE0.txt", and writes the string "unfortunate" to each file. The script then increments a counter '$i' and repeats the process, creating new text files with names "unfortunateC1.txt", "unfortunateD1.txt", and "unfortunateE1.txt". This process continues indefinitely.

The second script removes the text files created by the first script. It uses a loop that increments a counter '$i' and deletes the text files with names "unfortunateC$i.txt", "unfortunateD$i.txt", and "unfortunateE$i.txt". The script uses the Remove-Item cmdlet to delete each file from the C, D, and E drives. The loop continues to run for up to 30 seconds, after which it stops.
